# Dae's Mod
This mod is a collection of tweaks and features by DaeCatt

Adds the Gnome Wordsmith Townie, which allows you to reforge items into a given prefix.
  The Gnome Wordsmith will only join your town once both the Goblink Tinkerer and the Steampunker are present.
  Gnome Wordsmith sells the Portable Wormhole, which functions as a re-usable Wormhole potion, but will also let you teleport to Town NPCs.
  Gnome Wordsmith sells the Anomaly Detector, which highlights Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow akin to the Spelunker potion.

Adds the unlockable Endless Ammo Inventory. Craft at a Crystal Ball & Tinkerer Work Bench with an Endless Musket Pouch and an Endless Quiver.
  Endless Ammo Inventory unlocks the ability to convert crafted ammo into endless ammo.
  Unlocking the Endless Ammo Inventory immediately gives you endless Musket Balls and endless Wooden Arrows without needing them in your inventory.
